**Software Crisis (1960s-1980s):**

**Problems Identified:**

1. **Cost Overruns:** Projects consistently exceeded budgets by 200-300%
2. **Schedule Delays:** Delivery times were unpredictable and often years behind schedule
3. **Quality Issues:** Software was unreliable, contained numerous bugs, and frequently crashed
4. **Maintenance Problems:** Code was difficult to understand, modify, and maintain
5. **User Dissatisfaction:** Software didn't meet user requirements or expectations

**Causes:**

- Lack of systematic development approaches
- Poor project management practices
- Inadequate documentation
- No quality control measures

- Example: All input/output operations in one module
- Problem: May require different interfaces and data

**3. Temporal Cohesion:**

- Elements executed at the same time
- Example: System initialization module
- Problem: May have unrelated functionality

**4. Procedural Cohesion:**

- Elements follow specific execution sequence
- Example: Steps in a business process
- Problem: May operate on different data

**5. Communicational Cohesion:**

- Elements operate on same data structure
- Example: All functions working on customer record
- Better than previous types but not optimal

**6. Sequential Cohesion:**

- Output of one element becomes input of next
- Example: Data processing pipeline
- Good cohesion level

**7. Functional Cohesion (Best):**

**Basic Measures:**

- **n1** = Number of distinct operators (+, -, if, while, etc.)
- **n2** = Number of distinct operands (variables, constants)
- **N1** = Total number of operators
- **N2** = Total number of operands

**Derived Measures:**

- **Program Length:** N = N1 + N2
- **Program Vocabulary:** n = n1 + n2
- **Program Volume:** V = N × log₂(n)
- **Program Difficulty:** D = (n1/2) × (N2/n2)
- **Programming Effort:** E = D × V
- **Programming Time:** T = E/18 seconds

**Example:**

```c
int factorial(int n) {     // operators: int, =, (, ), {
    if (n <= 1)           // if, <=, 1
        return 1;         // return
    else                  // else
        return n * factorial(n - 1);  // *, -, }
}
```

**Cyclomatic Complexity:**

**Definition:** Measures the number of linearly independent paths through program code.

**Formula:** V(G) = E - N + 2P
Where:

- E = Number of edges in control flow graph
- N = Number of nodes in control flow graph
- P = Number of connected components (usually 1)

**Alternative Formula:** V(G) = Number of decision points + 1

**Control Flow Graph:**

- Nodes represent basic blocks of code
- Edges represent control flow between blocks
- Decision points: if, while, for, switch statements

**Example:**

```
if (x > 0) {        // Decision point 1
    y = x + 1;
    if (y > 10) {   // Decision point 2
        z = y * 2;
    }
}
Cyclomatic Complexity = 2 + 1 = 3
```

**Interpretation:**

- 1-10: Simple program, low risk
- 11-20: Moderate complexity, moderate risk
- 21-50: Complex program, high risk
- > 50: Very complex, very high risk

3. **External Inquiry (EQ):** Input-output combinations for queries
4. **Internal Logical File (ILF):** Data maintained within system
5. **External Interface File (EIF):** Data maintained by other systems

**Calculation Process:**

1. Count each function type
2. Classify complexity (Simple, Average, Complex)
3. Apply weighting factors:

   - EI: 3, 4, 6 points
   - EO: 4, 5, 7 points
   - EQ: 3, 4, 6 points
   - ILF: 7, 10, 15 points
   - EIF: 5, 7, 10 points

4. Calculate Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)

**Techniques:**

**1. Statement Coverage:**

- Execute every statement at least once
- Measures percentage of executed statements
- Formula: (Executed Statements / Total Statements) × 100

**2. Branch Coverage:**

- Execute every branch (true/false) at least once
- Ensures all decision outcomes tested
- Stronger than statement coverage

**3. Path Coverage:**

- Execute every possible path through code
- Most thorough but often impractical
- Exponential number of paths in loops

**4. Condition Coverage:**

- Test all individual conditions in decisions
- Each condition evaluated to true and false

**Example:**

```c
if (a > 0 && b < 10) {    // Branch with two conditions
    c = a + b;            // Statement 1
} else {
    c = a - b;            // Statement 2
}
```

**Test Cases for Branch Coverage:**

- Test 1: a=5, b=5 (true branch)
- Test 2: a=-1, b=15 (false branch)

### (b) Integration & Regression Testing [3 Marks]

**Integration Testing:**

**Definition:** Testing phase where individual software modules are combined and tested as a group to evaluate interfaces and interaction between integrated components.

**Purpose:**

- Verify interface between modules
- Detect integration defects
- Validate data flow between modules
- Ensure combined modules work correctly

**Types:**

**1. Big Bang Integration:**

- All modules integrated simultaneously
- System tested as whole
- Suitable for small systems
- Difficult to isolate defects

**2. Top-Down Integration:**

- Integration starts from top-level modules
- Lower-level modules integrated gradually
- Uses stubs for missing lower modules
- Early prototype possible

**3. Bottom-Up Integration:**

- Integration starts from lowest-level modules
- Higher-level modules added gradually
- Uses drivers to test lower modules
- Good for testing critical modules first

**4. Sandwich/Hybrid Integration:**

- Combination of top-down and bottom-up
- Integration from both ends towards middle
- Reduces integration time
- Requires more resources

**Test Drivers and Test Stubs:**

**Test Drivers:**

- **Purpose:** Simulate calling modules (higher-level modules)
- **Used in:** Bottom-up integration testing
- **Function:** Call the module under test and pass test data
- **Example:** Driver for database module that calls insert(), update(), delete() functions

```c
// Test Driver Example
void testDatabaseModule() {
    // Setup test data
    User testUser = {"John", "john@email.com"};

    // Call module functions
    insertUser(testUser);
    updateUser(testUser);
    deleteUser(testUser.id);

    // Verify results
    assert(getUserCount() == 0);
}
```

**Test Stubs:**

- **Purpose:** Simulate called modules (lower-level modules)
- **Used in:** Top-down integration testing
- **Function:** Return predefined responses to calling modules
- **Example:** Stub for database module that returns dummy data

```c
// Test Stub Example
User getUser(int id) {
    // Return dummy data instead of actual database call
    User dummyUser = {"Test User", "test@email.com"};
    dummyUser.id = id;
    return dummyUser;
}
```

**Regression Testing:**

**Definition:** Testing performed to ensure that changes (bug fixes, new features, modifications) haven't broken existing functionality.

**When Performed:**

- After bug fixes
